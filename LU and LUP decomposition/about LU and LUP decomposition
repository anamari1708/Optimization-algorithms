In numerical analysis and linear algebra, lowerâ€“upper (LU) decomposition or factorization factors a matrix as
the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. The product sometimes includes a permutation matrix as well.
LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. Computers usually solve square systems of linear equations
using LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a matrix or computing the determinant of a matrix.
LU decomposition was introduced by mathematician Tadeusz Banachiewicz in 1938.

The stability of LU decomposition is improved if pivoting is used to maximize the absolute values of the diagonal elements of the
upper triangular matrix U. The function LUP_decomp(A) performs LU-decomposition with partial pivoting. It is the same as the function
LU_matrix(A) except a pivoting section has been added. It returns an object consisting of the LU matrix, the permutation matrix,
and the number of row exchanges made during partial pivoting.
